# JUNE_Week5
This assignment is broken down into the below documents due to the excessive time in running the code in one notebook so I run them separately for each question (bullet point).
Notebook 1 – Naïve Bayes with Decision Tree
Notebook 2 – Naïve Bayes with Random Forest
Notebook 3 – Naïve Bayes with Ensemble Models
Summary Report
